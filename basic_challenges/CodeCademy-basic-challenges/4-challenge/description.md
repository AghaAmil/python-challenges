## Hide the credit card number

Write a function in Python that accepts a credit card number.
It should return a string where all the characters are hidden with an asterisk except the last four.
For example, if the function gets sent “4444444444444444”, then it should return “4444”.

I'm going to add some extra validation and functionality.
credit card number should be 16 digits

## Part 2:
Sample input: 1234123412341234

Sample output: 1234 **** **** 1234
