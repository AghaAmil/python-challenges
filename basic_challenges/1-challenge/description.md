# Challenge 1: Grade Calculator

Create a program that calculates grades for students using nested if-elif statements and a for loop. The program should:

1. Ask the user for the number of students.
2. For each student, ask for their name and score.
3. Use nested if-elif statements to determine the grade based on the score (A=90-100, B=80-89, C=70-79, D=60-69, F below 60).
4. Print out each student's name and grade as a list.

**Bonus**: Add possible error handling and exception if the user encountered an error.

**Note**: There is no exact output or solution to this problem. However, the result must be obtained.
