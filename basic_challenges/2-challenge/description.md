# Challenge 2: Prime Number Generator

Write a program that generates prime numbers up to a given limit using a for loop and if-elif statements. The program should:

1. Ask the user for the upper limit.
2. Use a for loop to iterate from 2 to the limit.
3. For each number, check if it's prime using if-elif statements.
4. Print out all prime numbers found.
